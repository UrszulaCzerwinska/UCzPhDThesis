This chapter will include biological interpretation of Pan-cancer analysis with DeconICA 

* application to Breast cancer

  * compare metagenes of the same cell type in different datasets 

  * compare metagenes of the same cell type in the same dataset (happens sometimes)

  * compare A matrix (sample weights) with clinical metadata

  * compare patients with opposite extreme phenotypes (the gene expression) with DEG ou others

  * run enrichment with more specific list of genes ex. Th1/2/17 cells in T cels etc.

    â€‹

* application pan cancer

  * derivation of meta-metagenes for immune cell types
  * above points are true for pan cancer
