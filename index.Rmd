<!-- # Prerequisites -->

<!-- This is a _sample_ book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. -->

<!-- For now, you have to install the development versions of **bookdown** from Github: -->

<!-- ```{r eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown") -->

<!-- Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading `#`. -->

This is PhD Thesis of [Urszula Czerwinska](urszulaczerwinska.github.io)\n\n
In many fields of science observations on a studied system represent complex mixtures of signals of various origin. Tumors are engulfed in a complex microenvironment (TME) that critically impacts progression and response to therapy. It includes tumor cells, fibroblasts, and a diversity of immune cells. It is known that under some assumptions, it is possible to separate complex signal mixtures, using classical and advanced methods of source separation and dimension reduction. In this work, I apply independent components analysis (ICA) to decipher sources of signals shaping transcriptomes (global quantitative profiling of mRNA molecules) of tumor samples, with a particular focus on immune system-related signals.  
    Firstly, I developed an R package: Deconvolution of transcriptome through Immune Component Analysis (DeconICA) for interpretation and quantification of signals obtained from blind source separation techniques (focused on immune signals). DeconICA is able to quantify immune cells with accuracy comparable with published methods in completely unsupervised setup. Secondly, we apply DeconICA to a big volume of data: over 100 datasets containing in total over 28000 samples of 40 tumor types generated by different technologies and processed independently. This analysis demonstrated that ICA-based immune signals are reproducible between datasets and three major immune cell types: T-cells, B-cells and Myeloid cells can be identified. ICA-derived metagenes  were used as a proxy to study characteristics of immune cells in different tumor types. The analysis revealed a huge diversity and plasticity of immune cells dependent and independent on tumor type. Specific elements of the study can be helpful in identification of drug targets or biomarkers for immunotherapy of cancer.
