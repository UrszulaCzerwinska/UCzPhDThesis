# Heterogeneity of immune cell types {#map}

Adapted from *submitted* article of Kondratova et al.  (co-first authored by me)

Explication how deconvolution methodology can be used for analysis of heterogeneity of immune cells 

* describe the context briefly

* describe more in details my part - data analysis of single cell data


Add CAFS (that will maybe appear in *JBM*)

Unpublished analysis made for the Nature Immunology *Michea et al.* paper  (to be defined)

The single T-cell study  (if happens)
