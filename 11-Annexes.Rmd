# Post Scriptum: Thesis writing {-}

This Thesis is written in [*bookdown*](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). I have chosen this form as it can easily compile to *LaTeX*, PDF, MS Word, ebook and  html. Optimally, the final manuscript will be also published online in a form of an open source [gitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/about) and an ebook including interactive figures and maybe even data demos. Another good reason for using  [*bookdown*](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) is its simple syntax of markdown and natural integration of code snippets with .Rmd. It reduces formatting time and give multiple outputs. 

The template of for this thesis manuscript was adapted from *LaTeX*  template provided by University Paris Descartes. 

Citations are stocked in Mendeley Desktop and exported to .bib files automatically.
