> *We are not students of some subject matter, but students of problems. And problems may cut right across the borders of any subject matter or discipline.*
> 														— Karl Popper

The piece of work you have between your hands or on your screen should collect fruits of an interdisciplinary research, or at least, was conceived in an interdisciplinary environment of Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Paris (CRI) in École doctorale *Frontières du Vivant* (FdV) . CRI's main mission can be formulated as follows:

> *to empower the students to take initiative and develop their own research projects **at the crossroads of life, learning, and digital sciences**.* [@CRIweb] 

Interdisciplinarity has many definitions and meanings. According to the book *Facilitating Interdisciplinary Research* [@FIRbook]

> *Interdisciplinary research and education are inspired by the drive to solve **complex questions** and problems, whether generated by scientific curiosity or by society, and lead researchers in different disciplines to meet at the **interfaces** and **frontiers** of those disciplines and even to **cross frontiers** to **form new disciplines**.*

For me, the essence of interdisciplinarity is the need to solve a complex problem, whatever expertise would be necessary to solve it. I consider that fighting cancer disease, deciphering cancer heterogeneity and its interactions with immune systems is a cause worth an interdisciplinary effort. 

However, though this preamble I would like not only praise the interdisciplinary research but also underline possible limitations and constraints that come with it and which could affect this thesis.

## What does interdisciplinarity in science mean in XXI century? {-}

In the ancient history, being formed and practice multiple disciplines was not anything unusual which is strongly reflected in Greek philosophy initiating the dispute about the division and hierarchical classification of knowledge. [@Slavicek2012]. Figures as Aristotle and Leonardo Da Vinci, that can be called *homo universals* served different disciplines from arts through history, natural sciences to mathematics.  With time human knowledge about the word, i.e. natural sciences got bigger and bigger, to the point that it became hard to master all the disciplines. The specialisation would allow to study in deep a certain subject and make discoveries about it. And even if, interdisciplinary efforts never stopped, for long time they were not mainstream in scientific communities divided into academies, chairs and specialization.

How we can define these separate units? Different fields differ in term of concept, method, tools, processes and theories [@Slavicek2012]. Thanks to division into scientific disciplines certain order is conserved across space and time. Hierarchical classification of knowledge comes with human nature. 

However, specialisation came with a price, 

>*advancing specialisation leads to gaps in the level of comprehension between individual disciplines and eventually gives rise to the demand for interdisciplinarity - in order to close the gaps between disciplines.*[@Slavicek2012] 

Nowadays, the knowledge is accessible and popular, therefore we can profit from achievements of different disciplines thanks to easy mean of communication. Two different terms  can be defined to initiatives that use the knowledge of different specialities:  multidisciplinarity which is a sum of efforts of different disciplines and interdisciplinarity that allows to profit from synergy of multiple disciplines (Fig. \@ref(fig:multidisc)). With interdisciplinary research and education come flexibility, creativity and novelty but also limit of depth on ingested knowledge and possibilities of cross-interactions between disciplines.

```{r multidisc, fig.cap='(ref:multidisc-caption)', out.width='100%', fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
if (is_pdf_output()) {
  knitr::include_graphics('figures-ext/multidisc.pdf')
} else {
  knitr::include_graphics('figures-ext/multidisc.png')
}
```

(ref:multidisc-caption) **Symbolic illustration of sum (multidisciplinarity) versus synergy (interdisciplinarity)**, an interdisciplinary project should have an added value compared to a multidisciplinary one. Inspired from [@Slavicek2012].

*What does it mean to be truly interdisciplinary in science today and why disciplines still exist? Do they?*

> *Scientists tend to resist interdisciplinary inquiries into their own territory. In many instances, such parochialism is founded on the fear that intrusion from other disciplines would compete unfairly for limited financial resources and thus diminish their own opportunity for research*
>  																	— [Hannes Alfvén](http://www.azquotes.com/author/28130-Hannes_Alfven) 

An example of truly interdisciplinary research can be work on the string theory that makes advance both mathematics and theoretical physics. Also new disciplines that recently emerged as biophysics and bioinformatics are fuit of the interdisciplinary approach. 

However, crossing frontiers is not an easy task.  Examples of early interdisciplinary efforts are nicely described by Ledford et al. [@Ledford2015] in *Nature* special issue on [Interdisciplinarity](https://www.nature.com/news/interdisciplinarity-1.18295). For example, Theodore Brown in 1980s, while trying to organise a big interdisciplinary effort and reorganise university space to engage exchange between students of different faculties, he encounter a lot of reluctance.

> *And then there was the stigma. “Interdisciplinary research is for people who aren't good enough to make it in their own field,” an illustrious physicist chided* [@Ledford2015].

The story seems to end up with a happy ending of 40-milion US dollars grant and foundation of Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology. However, recruiting open-minded director to lead this unconventional organisation was a struggle. Soon, the organisation became a model for others and met a great scientific success (creation of one of the first graphical web browsers).

Even though, since then the idea of interdisciplinary research spread around the world. Still, not all problem got overcome.

> *"There's a huge push to call your work interdisciplinary," says David Wood, a bioengineer at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. "But there's still resistance to doing actual interdisciplinary science".*

First, the institutions, universities where research is performed should equip scientist with a *passe-porte*, facilitate exchange of disciplines, funding the interdisciplinary research, accepting fusion of disciplines as new ones. Then, a proper communication between disciplines is necessary. Finally, forming interdisciplinary researches is extremely challenging as it often requires extra effort from an apprentice.

How interdisciplinariy changed then over years? Are all disciplines affected equally?  From the chart (Fig:\@ref(fig:interdisciplinary)) we can see that Social Studies of Medecine seems to be the most interdisciplinary field. In general Biology, Health and Biomedical Sciences seem to be more open into flow of knowledge from other fields than humanities. On the extreme opposite of health, Clinical Medecine appears to be very conservative field.

  )

*Are all the disciplines idependent units nowadays?*

Can we do molecular biology without technical, mathematical and computational support? Can we study cognitive science without knowledge of biology, physics and psychology? Can we advance medecine without basic research in biology, physiology, electronics?

## Strengths, Weaknesses Opportunities, Threats (SWOT) of an interdisciplinary PhD - personal perspective {-}

Being formed, first in double major of biology and mathematics, then participating in interdisciplinary projects during my master studies, I can witness that learning curve of multiple disciples is steep. It is also often associated with frustration of not going deep enough in all of disciplines. *Why?* Because of lack of time or energy, and because of developed curiosity to learn new things continuously. 

Coming with expertise of biology and mathematics, I got fascinated by complex biological systems. One way of study high-dimensional data and reduce them to smaller interpretable units. This is what I tempted to achieve in this thesis in order to enrich our knowledge about tumor microenvironment and possible contribute to orienting future research on immunotherapies. 

However, often an interdisciplinary research is not easy. *To which category do I belong?* *To whom should I present my work?*  I often asked myself these questions. I also often encountered lack of understanding where my methodological results were not bringing enough of *biological insights*. Or the constraints of my biological application seemed very obscured and complicated for mathematicians and my work often lacked *important methodological advances*. 

*Does it mean that my work is not accurate, useless?* Probably it is not enough, for many. However, I still hope that for some it is. For me, working with data and statistics does not mean much if it does not serve an actual purpose.  The table \@ref(tab:SWOT) summarize Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT analysis) of an interdisciplinary projects, in the way I see it. 

```{r SWOT, echo=FALSE, }

   column_spec(4, width = "9em",  border_left = T, border_right = T)

Besides conducting research that crosses the boundaries of one discipline, I also could meet and work with inspiring people coping like me with filling the gap in understanding of an interdisciplinary work. I gained (even if only superficial) understanding of many topics in mathematics, statistics, data science, immunology, cancer etc. 

## General context of the thesis {-}

> *The universe will lead me where I need to go. I am like a leaf in the stream of creation*
> ​													— Dirk Gently, Holistic detective

When finishing my master I was looking for an interdisciplinary subject where I could deepen my quantitative skills and apply to a real-life health problem. I came across a project proposed by Andrei Zinovyev in close collaboration with Vassili Soumelis. I was quite anxious that my knowledge of cancer immunology would not be sufficient to lead the project to a success. I recognise that the complexity and heterogeneity of immune systems are quite a mystery to me and even though I did my best efforts to learn during these three years, I am still far for being confortable. 

The project started by causal exploration of different blind source separation or dimension reduction techniques and their ability to dissect bulk transcriptomic data into cell type-related units. We also faced an important problem of lack of gold standard data that would define efficiency and accuracy of different methods. I have spent void efforts working of sophisticated simulation framework, I touched the border of my capacities to solve important statistical issue. In the meantime, many tools dissecting tumor bulk transcriptome were published. Serving a similar purpose, they used different means and assumptions, which leaved space for my project to continue. In my third year, I am finally publishing a tool that performs the analysis I developed together with the Sysbio team members, and I can apply it to a body of publicly available data sets to learn about actual problem: the immune system infiltrating cancers and the interactions occurring in the environment.

In parallel, I worked on exploration of brand new data type: single cell transcriptomic (RNAseq) in the context of tumor microenvironment.
