abstract = {Interdisciplinary team work combines the strengths of two or more disciplines with the aim of identifying problems, revealing associations, working out solutions to problems, and applying these. Such collaboration frequently yields new, unexpected, and possibly trail-blazing results. The remarkable aspects of interdisciplinary teams include the emerging insights and conclusions, which extend beyond the specialist's knowledge of his/her own speciality. These insights and conclusions are conceived and specified in interdisciplinary dialogue. Interdisciplinary work is increasingly used in the clinical sector to determine the optimal treatment regimen for the individual patient. In research it is used to find solutions to complex questions. It is also demanded in cross-disciplinary teaching. In this article we will describe the emergence of disciplines and highlight the historical context of interdisciplinary team work.},
