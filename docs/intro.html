<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 1</span> Immuno-biology of cancer</h1>
<p>This chapter will introduce a basic topic of cancer and participation of stroma in cancer development, progression and response to treatment. It will also describe most important types of data used to study cancer microenvironment.</p>
<div id="cancer-seen-as-complex-environment" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Cancer seen as complex environment</h2>
<p>According to <a href="http://globocan.iarc.fr/Pages/fact_sheets_cancer.aspx">GLOBOCAN study</a> <span class="citation">(Research in Cancer <a href="#ref-GLOBOCAN">2018</a>)</span>, 14.1 million cancer cases was estimated to happen around the world in 2012. It touched 7.4 million men and 6.7 million women. It is estimated that the cancer cases will increase almost two-fold to 24 million by 2035.</p>
<p>In France only, in 2012 there were 194552 cases of cancer, of which leading is Prostate cancer (29,2%) followed by Lung (14,4%) and Colorectal cancers (11,1%).</p>
<p>For a long time studying tumor was focused on tumor cells, their reprogramming, mutations. Cancer was seen as disease of uncontrolled cells. Recent discoveries moved research focus from tumor cells to tumor cells in their context: tumor microenvironment. We will describe here what is the composition and role of the TME in tumor progression, diagnosis and response to treatment.</p>
<div id="our-understanding-of-cancer-over-time" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> Our understanding of cancer over time</h3>
<p>Cancer was historically described by a physician Hippocrates (460–370 B.C) <span class="citation">(Sudhakar <a href="#ref-Sudhakar2009">2009</a>)</span>. Even though there exist even earlier evidence of the disease. Hippocrates stated that the body contained 4 humors (body fluids) : blood, phlegm, yellow bile and black bile. Any imbalance of these fluids will result in disease. Particularly the excess of black bile in an organ was meant to provoke cancer. For years, it was not known what factors cause cancer and it was easily confounded with other diseases. In the middle ages in the Renaissance Period it was believed cancer is a punishment for the sins they committed against their god, that they deserved it to some extend</p>
<p>Until 18th century it was believed that cancer is contagious and is spread by parasites.</p>
<p>In the 1850s, tumor cells started to be analysed by pathologists. They were strike with their ability to proliferate uncontrollably, ability to spread and destroy the original tissue <span class="citation">(NPR <a href="#ref-NPR2010">2010</a><a href="#ref-NPR2010">b</a>)</span>. Around the same time leukocytes from the blood was first described by Gabriel Andra and William Addison. Just a few years later, in 1845 Bennett and Virchow described blood cells in leukaemia. Virchow is also a father of Chronic irritation theory (which we would call chronic inflammation) that says that cancer cells spread resulting in metastasis.</p>
<p>In the 20th century, molecular causes started to be investigated. It was discovered that cancer could be caused by environmental factors, i.e. chemicals (carcinogens), radiation, viruses and also inherited from ancestors. Those factors would damage but contrary to a healthy condition they would not die.</p>
<p>During the 1970s, oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes were discovered. Oncogenes are genes that allow a cell to become cancer cell, while the tumor suppressor genes would repair DNA or execute cell death of a damaged cell.</p>
<p>Since the end of the 20th century, cancer screens are developed along with multiple strategies to fight tumor. Most classical ones are based on the idea of removing tumor cells (surgery), killing tumor cells with DNA-blocking drugs (chemotherapy), radiation, inhibit cancer growth (hormonal therapy, adjuvant therapy and immunotherapy). As non of those methods is fully efficient, often a combination of treatments is proposed. Nowadays, science is aming in the direction of trageted therapies and personalized treatment.</p>
<p>The recent success of immunotherapies (discussed in <a href="intro.html#immunotherapies">Immunotherapies section</a> made realise the scientific community how important is the context in which tumor cells are found. This context called Tumor Microenvironment, as well as the communication that happens within it between different agents, become a popular scientific topics of 21st century (Fig. <a href="intro.html#fig:pubmedTME">1.1</a>).</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.2.1</span> What is Tumor Microenvironment (TME)</h4>
<p>Tumor Microenvironment is a complex tissue that surrounds tumor cells. It is composed of blood and lymphatics vessels, epithelial cells, mesenchymal stem cells, fibroblast, adipocytes and a wide variety of immune cells. Their proportion and specific roles vary significantly with tumor type and stage. Communication between the environmental cells and the tumor is critical for tumor development and its impact on patient’s response to treatment.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.2.2</span> TME as a tumor ally</h4>
<p>In 1863 Rudolf Virchow observed a link between chronic inflammation and tumorigenesis. Accoriding to Virchov theory genetic damage would be the “match that lights the fire” of cancer, and the inflammation or cytokines produced by immune cells should be the “fuel that feeds the flames” <span class="citation">(Balkwill and Mantovani <a href="#ref-Balkwill2001">2001</a>)</span>. Therefore lymphocyte infiltration was confirmed by subsequent studies as a hallmark o cancer. The question one may ask is why our immune system does not defend the organism from tumor cells as it does in a range of bacterial and viral infections? It is mainly because of the ability of tumor cells to inhibit immune response through activation of negative regulatory pathways (so called immune checkpoints).</p>
<p>Many examples can be cited on how TME facilitates tumor development (Fig. <a href="intro.html#fig:met-dis">1.2</a>). For instance, in the early stages of tumorigenesis some macrophage phenotypes support tumor growth and mobility through TGF-beta signaling. Also, it was shown that NK cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) have an ability to suppress immune defence i.e. immunosurveillance by dendritic cells (DCs), T cell activation and macrophage polarisation and they promote tumor vascularisation as well. <span class="citation">(Talmadge and Gabrilovich <a href="#ref-Talmadge2013">2013</a>; Gabrilovich, Ostrand-Rosenberg, and Bronte <a href="#ref-Gabrilovich2012">2012</a>)</span> They create so-called niches that facilitates tumor colonization. Tregs and myeloid-derived suppressor cells can negatively impact natural immune defence and by these means allow growth and invasion of tumor cells <span class="citation">(Taube et al. <a href="#ref-Taube2017a">2017</a>)</span>. Another cell type, a part of ECM, fibroblast, or more precisely Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) have proven pro-tumor functions in breast cancer where they enhance metastasis <span class="citation">(Dumont et al. <a href="#ref-Dumont2013">2013</a>)</span>. The blood and lymphatic vessels maintain tumor growth providing necessary nutritive compound to malignant cells.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.2.3</span> Two-faced nature of immune cells</h4>
<p>In the 1960s, the immune surveillance theory hypothesized “the ability to identify and destroy nascent tumors as a central asset of the immune system” <span class="citation">(Sebeok <a href="#ref-Sebeok1976">1976</a>; Burnet <a href="#ref-Burnet1970">1970</a>)</span>, but it was highly criticized in consequence of no increase in tumor incidence in athymic nude mice <span class="citation">(Stutman <a href="#ref-Stutman1974">1974</a>; <span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Rygaard1976"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>. Later it was shown, that this mice model was not adequate <span class="citation">(Cavallo et al. <a href="#ref-Cavallo2011">2011</a>)</span>. Over the years, it was shown that the immune surveillance theory was not wrong, but was not completely right neither.</p>
<p>Recent studies unveil ambivalent nature of immune cells of TME. While some as cytotoxic T cells, B cells and macrophages can manage to eliminate tumor cells. Treg cells role is to regulate expansion and activation of T and B cells. Depending on cancer type, they can be either pro- or anit- tumor. For example as it has been shown for Tregs, they can be also associated with improved survival (i.e. in colorectal cancer <span class="citation">(Frey et al. <a href="#ref-Frey2010">2010</a>)</span>. For innate immunity, there are widely accepted M1 (ani-tumor) and M2 (pro-tumor) extreme macrophages phenotypes in TME <span class="citation">(Qian and Pollard <a href="#ref-Qian2010">2010</a>)</span>. Most of the statements seem to be context dependent and not valid universally across all cancer types. We already mentioned Macrophages phenotypic plasticity as well as different behaviour of EMC depending on tumor stage.</p>
<p>From more general point of view, it has been observed that immunodeficiency can correlate with high cancer incidence. Results of analysis based on observations of 25,914 female immunosuppressed organ transplant recipients, the tumor incidence was higher than predicted for multiple cancers. However, the number of breast cancer cases decreased which can be really disturbing if we need to decide on the role of immune defence in tumor progression <span class="citation">(Stewart et al. <a href="#ref-Stewart1995">1995</a>)</span>. This trend was confirmed through a study on individuals with AIDS and other studies. This indicates that immune microenvironment can be cancer stimulating or inhibiting depending on the type of cancer.</p>

<div id="cancer-immune-phenotypes" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.3</span> Cancer immune phenotypes</h3>
<p>Since 20. century physicians decided on common nomenclature that classify tumors into distinct groups that are relatively homogenous or that share common characteristic important for treatment and prognosis. Tumor typing should help to better asses predicting prognosis, to adapt a therapy to the clinical situation, to enable therapeutic studies which are essential in proving any therapeutic progress.</p>
<p>Most of the classifications are based on clinical data. Most common factors taken into account are: the degree of local invasion, the degree of remote invasion, histological types of cancer with specific grading for each type of cancer, possibly various tumour markers, general status of the patient.</p>
<p>With a progress of molecular biology also gene markers or proteomic abnormalities can be part of classification panel.</p>
<p>Since the increase of importance of the immunotherapies, researches proposed several ways to classify tumors based on their microenvironment. Given different parameters describing TME, cancers can be sorted into groups that show similar characteristics. We will discuss most common frameworks that allow to phenotype cancers based on the TME.</p>
<p>The localisation of the immune cells can be an indicator of the state and response to the therapy <span class="citation">(Bindea et al. <a href="#ref-Bindea2013">2013</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The most standard approach is to convey an analysis of histopathological cuts to asses the number of infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Two typical patterns are usually identified: “hot” - immune inflamed and “cold” - no active immune response <span class="citation">(Berghoff, Kather, and Jäger <a href="#ref-Berghoff2018">2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Chen and Mellman (<a href="#ref-Chen2017">2017</a>)</span> describes classification into inflamed and non-inflamed tumors, where non-inlamed phenotypes: can be further split into the immune-desert phenotype and the immune–excluded phenotype (Fig. <a href="intro.html#fig:immune-phenotypes">1.3</a>). The inflamed phenotype is characterised by rich presence of immune cells : T cells, myeloid cells, monocytes in tumor margin. Along with the immune cels, due to their communication, a high expression of cytokines is characteristic for this phenotype. According to Chen2017, this is a mark of anti-tumor response that was arrested by tumor. The inflamed phenotype has shown to be most responsive to immunotherapies. In the immune-excluded phenotype, the immune cells are present as well but located in the stroma <span class="citation">(Herbst et al. <a href="#ref-Herbst2014">2014</a>)</span>, sometimes penetrating inside tumor. However, when exposed to check point immuotherapy, T cells does not gain the ability to infiltrate the tumor, therefore the treatment is inefficient. The immune-desert main features is little or no presence of immune cells, especially T cells. Surprisingly, this tumors have been to proven to rarely respond to the checkpoint therapy <span class="citation">(Herbst et al. <a href="#ref-Herbst2014">2014</a>)</span>. In non-inflamed tumours cytokines associated with immune suppression or tolerance are expressed.</p>

<p>The immunogenicity of the tumors can be explained by tumor-intrinsic factors and tumor-extrinsic factors <span class="citation">(Gajewski et al. <a href="#ref-Gajewski2006">2006</a>)</span>. Tumor-intrinsic factors are, the neoantigen load and frequency, the mutational load, the expression of immunoinhibitors and immunostimulators (e.i. PD-L1), and alteration of HLA class I molecules. Tumor-extrinsic factors include chemokines regulating T cell trafficking, infiltration of effector TILs and immunosuppressive TILs, and soluble immunomodulatory factors (cytokines).</p>
<p>A plethora of different computational methods have been developed in order to further characterize tumor samples using different factors. We mention here mainstream methods that cover different approaches of scoring the TME-cancer phenotype.</p>

<p>Different approaches are based on gene expression patterns. Most commonly, machine learning supervised algorithms are trained to match known phenotype (established with microscopy or with clinical features) to genetic patterns or an unsupervised clustering is used to discover new classification.</p>
<p>An example of well-formulated classification framework is Immunophenoscore <span class="citation">(Charoentong et al. <a href="#ref-Charoentong2017">2017</a>)</span>, based on publication of <span class="citation">Angelova et al. (<a href="#ref-Angelova2015">2015</a>)</span>, where methylome, transcriptome and mutation of TCGA CRC dataset (n = 598) was used to describe <em>immunophenotypes</em>. Later on, it was reduced to gene expression indicator and summarised in a form of a score. In This scoring scheme is based on the data of 20 solid tumors, using expression of marker genes selected by a Machine Learning algorithm (random forest) for best prediction in each cancer. These indicators can be grouped into four categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>MHC molecules (MHC)</li>
<li>Immunomodulators (CP)</li>
<li>Effector cells (EC)</li>
<li>Suppressor cells (SC)</li>
</ul>
<p>The immunophenscore (IPS) is calculated on a 0-10 scale based on the expression of genes in each category. Stimulatory factors (cell types) impact the score positively and inhibitory factors (cell types) negatively. Z-scores ≥ 3 were designated as IPS10 and z-scores ≤ 0 are designated as IPS0. A similar conceptual framework called <em>cancer immunogram</em> was proposed by <span class="citation">Blank et al. (<a href="#ref-Blank2016">2016</a>)</span> included seven parameters: tumor foreignness (Mutational load), general immune status (Lymphocyte count), immune cell infiltration (Intratumoral T cells), absence of checkpoints (PD-L1), absence of soluble inhibitors (IL–6, CRP), absence of inhibitory tumor metabolism (LDH, glucose utilisation), tumor sensitivity to immune effectors (MHC expression, IFN-γ sensitivity). Nonetheless, the details of <em>cancer immunogram</em> use in practice remain unclear and result could be sensitive to patients’ and data heterogeneity as no standardisation was proposed.</p>

<div id="cancer_Therapies" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> Cancer therapies</h3>
<p>Cancer is a complex disease. Up to date, no uniform and fully effective treatment was proposed and usually different strategies are tested to kill tumor cells. <strong>Surgery</strong> is one of the oldest methods. The cancer is removed from the patient body. There are different ways, more or less invasive, that it can be performed. it is usually applied for solid tumor contained in a small area. <strong>Radiation Therapy</strong> uses high doses of radiation to eliminate tumor cells and shrink tumor mass. It can be applied externally or internally. <strong>Chemotherapy</strong> uses a drug (or a combination of drugs) that kill cancer cells, usually altering cell proliferation and growth. The drawback of radiotherapy and chemotherapy are strong side effects. <strong>Hormone therapy </strong> modulate hormone levels in the body in order to inhibit tumor growth in breast and prostate cancers. In leukemia and lymphoma, can be applied <strong>stem cell transplants</strong> that restore blood-forming stem cells destroyed by the very high doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy that are used to treat certain cancers.</p>
<p>Alternatively, <strong>targeted therapies</strong> represent more focused strategy that aims to be more effective and cause less side effects than systematic therapies. Two main types of targeted therapies are small-molecule drugs and monoclonal antibodies. Targeted therapies usually aim to stimulate/inhibit a selected molecular function. A special types of targeted therapies are <strong>Immunotherapies</strong>. Through adtivation/inhibition of immune regulatory pathways, it stimulates immune system to destroy malignant cells. A continuation of targeted therapies is <strong>precision medecine approach</strong>. It is based on genetic information to specify patient’s profile and find adapted treatment. A number of innovative treatments targeting a specific change in tumor ecosystem are being tested presently in precision medicine clinical trials <span class="citation">(Institute <a href="#ref-NCI2018">2017</a>)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="recent-progress-in-immuno-therapies" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.2</span> Recent progress in immuno-therapies</h3>
<p>The immunotherapies, in contrast with other types of cancers therapies discussed in <a href="intro.html#cancer_Therapies">the previous chapter</a>, aim to trigger or restart the immune system to defend the organism and attack the malignant cells. All this, however without provoking persisting inflammation state <span class="citation">(Predina et al. <a href="#ref-Predina2013">2013</a>)</span></p>
<p>The idea of stimulating immune system to fight malignant cell was not born recently. Since a long time a possibility of development of an anti-cancer vaccine has been investigated. Unfortunately, this idea faced two important limitations 1) lack of knowledge of antigens that should be used in vaccine to successfully stimulate cytotoxic T cells 2) the ability of cancer to block the immune response also called <em>immunostat</em>. Despite those impediments works on anti-tumor vaccines do not cease <span class="citation">(Palucka and Banchereau <a href="#ref-Palucka2013">2013</a>)</span>. A very recent promising an in-situ ani-tumor vaccine was proposed by Sagiv-Barfi et al. <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Sagiv-Barfi2018"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>. The therapy tested in mice, would be based on local injections of the combination of “unmethylated CG-enriched oligodeoxynucleotide (Cp-G) - a Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) ligand and anti-OX40 antibody. Low doses of CpG injected into a tumor induce the expression of OX40 on CD4+ T cells in the microenvironment in mouse or human tumors. An agonistic anti-OX40 antibody can then trigger a T cell immune response, which is specific to the antigens of the injected tumor”. Sagiv-Barfi et al. claim this therapy could be applied to all tumor types, as long as they are leucocyte-infiltrated. As a local therapy, in situ vaccination should have less side-effects than systematic administration. It is now undergoing clinical trials to test its efficiency in human patients.</p>
<p>Another idea involving using immune system as a weapon to fight cancer, would be the use of genetically modified patient’s T-cells, carrying <em>CARs</em> (chimeric antigen receptors) <span class="citation">(Jackson, Rafiq, and Brentjens <a href="#ref-Jackson2016">2016</a>)</span>. After a long period of small unsuccessful trials, recently in 2017, two CAR T-cell therapies were accepted, one to “treat adults with certain type of large B-cell lymphoma” <span class="citation">(Health and Services <a href="#ref-FDACARTadult">2017</a><a href="#ref-FDACARTadult">b</a>)</span>, other to treat “children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)” <span class="citation">(Health and Services <a href="#ref-FDACARTALL">2017</a><a href="#ref-FDACARTALL">a</a>)</span> , which are, at the same time, the first two gene therapies accepted by FDA.</p>
<p>However, the two most promising immuno-related strategies with proven clinical efficiency are based on blocking so called immune check point inhibitors: cytotoxic T-lymphocyte protein 4 (CTLA4) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). The anti-CLTA4 antibodies blocks repressive action of CLTA4 on T-cells and they become therefore activated. It was shown efficient in melanoma patients and accepted by FDA in 2015 as adjuvant therapy for stage III metastatic melanoma patients <span class="citation">(Health and Services <a href="#ref-FDACTLA4">2015</a>)</span>. PD-1 is a cell surface receptor of T cells, that binds to PD-L1/PD-L2. After binding, an immunosuppressive pathway is activated and T cells activity is dampened. An action of an anti-PD-L1 antibody is to prevent this immune exhaustion <span class="citation">(Chen and Mellman <a href="#ref-Chen2017">2017</a>)</span>. A stepping stone for anti-PD-L1 therapies was approval of Tecentriq (atezolizumab) for Bladder cancer <span class="citation">(Health and Services <a href="#ref-FDAPDL1Bladder">2016</a><a href="#ref-FDAPDL1Bladder">a</a>)</span> and anit-PD1 Keytruda (pembrolizumab) initially accepted for NSCLC and further extended to head and neck cancer, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, gastric cancer and microsatellite instability-high cancer <span class="citation">(Health and Services <a href="#ref-FDAPDL1NSCLC">2016</a><a href="#ref-FDAPDL1NSCLC">b</a>)</span>. Since other anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD1 antibodies were accepted or entered advanced stages of clinical trials <span class="citation">(Wolchok <a href="#ref-Wolchok2015">2015</a>)</span>.

<p>The main drawback of immunotherapies is a heterogeneity of response rate, which can vary i.e. from 10–40% in case of PD-L1blocking <span class="citation">(Zou, Wolchok, and Chen <a href="#ref-Zou2016">2016</a>)</span>, suggesting that some patient can have more chances than others to respond to an immune therapy. So far, it has been shown that anti PD-L1 therapies works more effectively in T cell infiltrated tumors with exclusion of Tregs because of lack of difference in expression of FOXP3 in responding and non-responding group of patients <span class="citation">(Herbst et al. <a href="#ref-Herbst2014">2014</a>)</span>. Also some light has been shade by <span class="citation">Rizvi et al. (<a href="#ref-Rizvi2015">2015</a>)</span> who connected mutational rate of cancer cells to the chances of response to an immunotherapy.</p>
<p>Despite those fundings, the precise qualifications of patients that should be sensitive to an immunotherapy are not defined <span class="citation">(Pitt et al. <a href="#ref-Pitt2016">2016</a>)</span>. As most patients do not answer to immunotherapies, it stimulates researches to look for better biomarkers and patient stratifications, and pharmaceutical industries to discover new immune checkpoints based therapies.</p>

Current pathology practice utilises chromogenic immunohistochemistry (IHC) <span class="citation">(NPR <a href="#ref-RamosVara2010">2010</a><a href="#ref-RamosVara2010">a</a>)</span>. Multiplexed approaches allow to identify multiple markers in the same histopathology cut.

<p>The main advantage of aforementioned technics the number of cells that can be analysed and the information about spatial distribution of the different cell types. The limiting factor, as for <a href="intro.html#facs">cell sorting methods</a>, is the number of markers (~10-100) and consequently number of cell types that can be identified <span class="citation">(Schelker et al. <a href="#ref-Schelker2017">2017</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>RNA-seq data was proven to be a useful indicator for clinical applications <span class="citation">(Mody et al. <a href="#ref-Mody2015">2015</a>; Oberg et al. <a href="#ref-Oberg2016">2016</a>; Robinson et al. <a href="#ref-Robinson2017">2017</a>)</span>.

<div id="epigenome" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.3.3.2</span> Epigenome</h4>
<p>An epigenome can be defined as a record of the chemical changes to the DNA and histone proteins of an organism. Changes to the epigenome can provoke changes to the structure of chromatin and changes to the function of the genome <span class="citation">(Bernstein, Meissner, and Lander <a href="#ref-Bernstein2007">2007</a>)</span>. Epigenome data usually contains information about methylation CpG island changes. In cancer, global genomic hypomethylation, CpG island promoter hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes, an altered histone code for critical genes, a global loss of monoacetylated and trimethylated histone H4 were observed. Mathylome profiles can be also use as molecular signature [NMF and other ref]</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.3.3.3</span> Single cell RNA-seq</h4>
<p>Described above methods of process DNA from hundreds of thousands of cells simultaneously and report averaged gene expression of all cells. In contrast, scRNA-seq technology allows getting results for each cell individually. This is tremendous step forward enhancement of our understanding of cell heterogeneity and opens new avenues of research questions.</p>
<p>Continuous discovery of new immune subtypes has proven that cell surface markers that are used for phenotyping by techniques like <a href="intro.html#facs">FACS</a> and <a href="intro.html#staining">immunohistochelistry</a> cannot capture the full complexity. ScRNA-seq methods allow to cluster known cell types in subpopulations based on their genetic features <span class="citation">(Papalexi and Satija <a href="#ref-Papalexi2017">2017</a>)</span>. ScRNA-seq is also able to capture particularly rare cell types as it requires much less of RNA material (1 ng isolated from 100-1000 cells) compared to ‘bulk’ RNA-seq ( ~ 1 μg of total mRNA transcripts ). It also allow to study cells at high resolution where the phenotypes can re-defined in much more refined scale than previously <span class="citation">(Papalexi and Satija <a href="#ref-Papalexi2017">2017</a>)</span></p>
<p>This new data type also brings into the field new challenges related to data processing due to the volume, distribution, noise, and biases. Experts highlight as the most “batch effect”, “noise” and “dropout effect” <span class="citation">(Perkel <a href="#ref-Perkel2017">2017</a>)</span>. So far, there are no official standards that can be applied which makes data comparison and post-processing even more challenging. Up to date, there are around 70 reported tools and resources for single cell data processing <span class="citation">(Davis <a href="#ref-Davis2016">2016</a>)</span> .</p>
<p>A limited number of single-cell datasets of tumors are made publicly available (@ TABLE ?).</p>
<p>One can ask why then developing computational deconvolution of transcriptome if we can learn relevant information from single-cell data. Today’s reality is that single cell data does not provide a straightforward answer to the estimation of cell proportions. The coverage is not full and sequenced single cells are not fully representative of the true population. For instance, neutrophiles are not found in scRNA-seq data because of they are “difficult to isolate, highly labile <em>ex vivo</em> and therefore difficult to preserve with current single-cell methods” <span class="citation">(Schelker et al. <a href="#ref-Schelker2017">2017</a>)</span>. In addition, a number of patients included in published studies of range &lt;100 cannot be compared to thousand people cohorts sequenced with bulk transcriptome methods. This is mostly because single cell experiments are challenging to perform, especially in clinical setting as fresh samples are needed <span class="citation">(Schelker et al. <a href="#ref-Schelker2017">2017</a>)</span>. Today, single cell technology brings very interesting “zoom in” perspective, but it would be incautious to make fundings from a restricted group of individuals universal to the whole population. Major brake to the use of single cell technology more broadly might be as well the price that is neatly 10x higher for single cell sample compared to bulk <span class="citation">(Core <a href="#ref-Cedar2018">2016</a>)</span>.</p>
