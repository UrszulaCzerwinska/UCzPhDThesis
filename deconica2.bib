abstract = {While many age-associated immune changes have been reported, a comprehensive set of metrics of immune aging is lacking. Here we report data from 243 healthy adults aged 40-97, for whom we measured clinical and functional parameters, serum cytokines, cytokines and gene expression in stimulated and unstimulated PBMC, PBMC phenotypes, and cytokine-stimulated pSTAT signaling in whole blood. Although highly heterogeneous across individuals, many of these assays revealed trends by age, sex, and CMV status, to greater or lesser degrees. Age, then sex and CMV status, showed the greatest impact on the immune system, as measured by the percentage of assay readouts with significant differences. An elastic net regression model could optimally predict age with 14 analytes from different assays. This reinforces the importance of multivariate analysis for defining a healthy immune system. These data provide a reference for others measuring immune parameters in older people.},

@article{Sergushichev2016,
abstract = {Gene set enrichment analysis is a widely used tool for analyzing gene expression data. However, current implementations are slow due to a large number of required samples for the analysis to have a good statistical power. In this paper we present a novel algorithm, that efficiently reuses one sample multiple times and thus speeds up the analysis. We show that it is possible to make hundreds of thousands permutations in a few minutes, which leads to very accurate p-values. This, in turn, allows applying standard FDR correction procedures, which are more accurate than the ones currently used. The method is implemented in a form of an R package and is freely available at $\backslash$url{\{}https://github.com/ctlab/fgsea{\}}.},
