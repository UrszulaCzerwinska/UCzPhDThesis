# Study of sensitivity  of known methods 

## Reproducibility of NMF versus ICA

* Comparing metagenes obtained with NMS vs ICA. 
* Explain why ICA is more reproducible 



## Impact of modification of signatures list on result for signature-based deconvolution methods

Carry on a "sensitivity study": 

* remove some % of genes from basis matrix or marker gene list
* evaluate how it changes results
