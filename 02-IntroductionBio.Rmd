# Immuno-biology of cancer {#intro} 

This chapter will first introduce a short history of cancer with a focus on discoveries linking cancer and its environment. It will also describe participation of TME in cancer development, progression and response to treatment. It will refer as well most important types of data used to study cancer microenvironment. It will show a link between tumor immune-biology and cancer phenotyping for development of immunotherapies.

## Cancer disease

According to [GLOBOCAN study]( http://globocan.iarc.fr/Pages/fact_sheets_cancer.aspx) [@GLOBOCAN], 14.1 million cancer cases was estimated to happen around the world in 2012. It touched 7.4 million men and 6.7 million women. It is estimated that the cancer cases will increase almost two-fold to 24 million by 2035.

In France only, in 2012 there were 194552 cases of cancer, of which leading is Prostate cancer (29,2%) followed by Lung (14,4%) and Colorectal cancers (11,1%). 

For a long time studying tumor was focused on tumor cells, their reprogramming, mutations. Cancer was seen as disease of uncontrolled cells by the mainstream research. At the same time, the idea of  importance of the impact of other cells and structures  on cancer cells was present but often not believed.  Recent success of immunotherapies moved research focus to tumor cells in their context: tumor microenvironment. We will describe here what is the composition and role of the TME in tumor progression, diagnosis and response to treatment. 

### Historical understanding of cancer {#hist}  

Cancer was historically described by a physician Hippocrates (460–370 B.C) [@Sudhakar2009]. Even though there exist even earlier evidence of the disease. Hippocrates stated that the body contained 4 humors (body fluids) : blood, phlegm, yellow bile and black bile. Any imbalance of these fluids will result in disease. Particularly the excess of black bile in an organ was meant to provoke cancer. For years, it was not known what factors cause cancer and it was easily confounded with other diseases. In the middle ages in the Renaissance Period it was believed cancer is a punishment for the sins they committed against their god, that they deserved it to some extend

Until 18th century it was believed that cancer is contagious and is spread by parasites.

In the 19th century, tumor cells started to be analysed by pathologists. They were strike with their ability to proliferate uncontrollably, ability to spread and destroy the original tissue [@NPR2010]. Around the same time leukocytes from the blood was first described by Gabriel Andra and William Addison. Just a few years later, in 1845 Bennett and Virchow described blood cells in leukaemia  (Fig. \@ref(fig:Virchow-cell)). . Virchow is also a father of Chronic irritation theory (which we would call chronic inflammation) that says that cancer is caused by local "irritation" and, incorrectly, that cancer cells spread like liquid resulting in metastasis.

```{r Virchow-cell, fig.cap='(ref:Virchow-cell-caption)', out.width='100%', fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('figures-ext/01-Virchow-cell.jpg')
```

(ref:Virchow-cell-caption) **Illustration of Virchow's cell theory**. Virchow depicted different cells transformation due to irritation.  [@Virchow1847] 

In 1889, Stephen Paget introduced *soil and seed*  hypothesis of metastases [@Paget1889]. He formulates it as follows 

> *When a plant goes to seed, its seeds are carried in all directions, but they can only live and grow if they fall on congenial soil.*

Which is a parallel to cancer cells disseminated by body fluids, and they can grow only tissues - "soil" that is predisposed to host the cancer cell - "the seed". He focused on the importance of tissue characteristics that favorise tumor development as opposed to most researchers of his time that were focusing on the "seed" itself.

In the 20th century, molecular causes started to be investigated. It was discovered that cancer could be caused by environmental factors, i.e. chemicals (carcinogens), radiation, viruses and also inherited from ancestors. Those factors would damage but contrary to a healthy condition they would not die.

Also in 1909, Paul Ehrlich, called one of fathers of immunology and Nobel Prize laureate, indicated a link between immune system and tumor suppression [@Ehrlich1909]. One of remarkable first immontherapy attempts can be attributed to William Coley, that practiced injecting streptococcus bacteria directly into patients after cancer surgery in 1891, later called "Colley vaccine". However, the impact of this procedure on patients recovery was judged by scientific community as "unclear".

In 1968, Melvin Greenblatt and Philippe Shubik showed that tumour transplants secete a substance stimulating the growth of blood vessels [@Greenblatt1968], later identified as "tumour angiogenic factor (TAF)" by Judah Folkman in 1971 [@Folkman1971]. Folkman also suggested that TAF can target of therapy itself which was a revolutional idea, as it did not target the tumor cells but their environment.

During the 1970s, oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes were discovered. Oncogenes are genes that allow a cell to become cancer cell, while the tumor suppressor genes would repair DNA or execute cell death of a damaged cell. A new dimention to cancer studies was added in the 1980s, epigenetic changes was proven to occur to both oncogenes and tumour suppressors [@Feinberg1983; @Greger1989], which are presently known as epigenetic markers used for diagnostics and therapeutic targets for cancer.

In 1982, Aline van Pel and Thierry Boon [@Pel1982] discovered that a specific immunity to spontanious tumor cells could be induced by vaccinating mice with mutagenized tumour cells. This araised an inspiration for many years of immune therapy developement.

In Napoleone Ferrara and colleagues identified gene encoding vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that was shown to stimulate growth of enothelial cells proliferation *in vitro* and angiogenesis (blood vessels formation) *in vivo* [@Leung1989].

In 1999 for the first time, gene-expression was used to study cancer (leukeamia) by Todd Golub, Donna Slonim and colleagues [@Golub1999].

Since the end of the 20th century, cancer screens are developed along with multiple strategies to fight tumor. Most classical ones are based on the idea of removing tumor cells (surgery), killing tumor cells with DNA-blocking drugs (chemotherapy), radiation, inhibit cancer growth (hormonal therapy, adjuvant therapy and immunotherapy). As non of those methods is fully efficient, often a combination of treatments is proposed. Nowadays, science is aming in the direction of trageted therapies and personalized treatment.  

The recent success of immunotherapies (discussed in [Immunotherapies section](#immunotherapies) attracted the attention the scientific community again to the context in which tumor cells are found. This context called Tumor Microenvironment, as well as the communication that happens within it between different agents, nowadays studied differently with available knowledge of molecular biology, become a popular scientific topics of 21st century (Fig. \@ref(fig:pubmedTME)).

### Tumor micro environment as a complex system 

> ALL IS CONNECTED
>   —Dirk Gently, holistic detective

#### What is Tumor Microenvironment (TME)

Tumor Microenvironment is a complex tissue that surrounds tumor cells. It is composed of different compartments (in solid tumors):

* Stroma:  blood and lymphatics vessels, epithelial cells, mesenchymal stem cells,  fibroblast, adipocytes supported by extracellular matrix (EM) 
*  Immune cells: T cells, B cells, NK cells, Dendritic cells,  Macorphages, Monocytes etc. 

Their proportion and specific roles vary significantly with tumor type and stage. Communication between the environmental cells and the tumor is critical for tumor development and its impact on patient's response to treatment. These communication between different compartments is bidirectional and all the players  can influence each other. Depending on the nature and prevailing direction of those interactions different destiny is possible for each of the compartments, i.e. immune cells  can be recruited to protect tumor cells or they can kill them directly. Many of the signals can be contradictory, many can suppress each other. Then is it possible to tilt this complex ecosystem into patients' favour? Can we decipher the most important factors of this molecular knot and manipulate it? 

This chapter describes different scenarios of interaction within TME in order to illustrate the complexity of TME and possible targets for cancer therapies.

```{r video1, echo=FALSE, results='asis', eval=is_html_output()}
cat("We recommend watching this video in order to visualise the TME and cancer thanks to 3D animations

<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/K09xzIQ8zsg\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe> ")
```

#### Interactions between TME and Tumor

Three scenarios can be considered to describe the relationship between TME and tumor cells:

1. TME stimulates  tumor growth and/or  progression and/or impact negatively the response to treatment
2. TME has no impact on tumor cells and disease development
3. TME has a tumor suppressive role and impact positively the response to treatment

As can be seen partly in [Historical understanding of cancer](#hist) these three hypothesis were gaining and loosing popularity in scientific and medical community.

##### TME as a foe: inflammation

In 1863 Rudolf Virchow observed a link between chronic inflammation and tumorigenesis. According to Virchov theory genetic damage would be the “match that lights the fire” of cancer, and the inflammation or cytokines produced by immune cells should be the “fuel that feeds the flames” [@Balkwill2001]. Therefore lymphocyte infiltration was confirmed by subsequent studies as a hallmark o cancer. The question one may ask is why our immune system does not defend the organism from tumor cells as it does in a range of bacterial and viral infections? It is mainly because of the ability of tumor cells to inhibit immune response through activation of negative regulatory pathways (so called immune checkpoints).

Many examples can be cited on how TME facilitates tumor development (Fig. \@ref(fig:met-dis)). For instance, in the early stages of tumorigenesis some macrophage phenotypes support tumor growth and mobility through TGF-beta signaling. Also, it was shown that NK cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) have an ability to suppress immune defence i.e. immunosurveillance by dendritic cells (DCs), T cell activation and macrophage polarisation and they promote tumor vascularisation as well. [@Talmadge2013; @Gabrilovich2012] They create so-called niches that facilitates tumor colonization. Tregs and myeloid-derived suppressor cells can negatively impact natural immune defence and by these means allow growth and invasion of tumor cells [@Taube2017a]. Another cell type, a part of ECM, fibroblast, or more precisely Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) have proven pro-tumor functions in breast cancer where they enhance metastasis [@Dumont2013]. The blood and lymphatic vessels maintain tumor growth providing necessary nutritive compound to malignant cells.

}
```

(ref:met-dis-caption) **The microenvironment supports metastatic dissemination and colonization at secondary sites.**  Different tumor sites can communicate through exosomes realized by tumor cells and also immune and stromal cells such as NK cells, CAFs and DCs.

According to [@Hanahan2012] immune and stroma cells participate in almost all of Cancer Hallmarks [@Hanahan2000; @Hanahan2012] : Most of the hallmarks of cancer are enabled and sustained to varying degrees through contributions from repertoires of stromal cell types and distinctive subcell types.

##### TME seen as neutral

In front of lack of definitive proof that TME can positively or negatively impact on tumor development, many scientist, for long time, ignored the importance of this factor.  Until the early-mid eighties, the TME research was mostly limited to angiogenesis and immune environment and most areas that are now driving the field were not represented. 

From early 70. until the end of the 90. the most accepted statement was that genetic alterations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are both necessary and sufficient to initiate tumorigenesis and drive tumor progression. Therefore TME was not seen as an important element of the puzzle. 

The cancer geneticists, at the time had a lot of influence on scientific community diminishing the work of made on TME which were considered as “uninteresting” and definitely not "mainstream".

After 90. with discovery of singling molecules involved in communication of TME like VEGF. Also discoveries made by developmental biology field supported the hypothesis that microenvironment plays an important role in development which was later shown for tumorigenesis. Also success of immune vaccines starting with the tuberculosis vaccine Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) in 1976 and finishing, at the moment with checkpoint inhibitors did not leave the scientific community indifferent. 

##### TME as a friend: immunosurveillance

As mentioned in  [Historical understanding of cancer](#hist) Paget proposed a hypothesis of "seed and soil" where the TME in a certain tissue (the soil) can either stimulate or suppress the metastasis (the seed). William Coley tested a possibility to trigger tumorsuppressive  effect via stimulation of the immune system with bacteria.  In the 1960s, the immune surveillance theory hypothesized "the ability to identify and destroy nascent tumors as a central asset of the immune system" [@Sebeok1976; @Burnet1970], but it was highly criticized in consequence of no increase in tumor incidence in athymic nude mice [@Stutman1974; @Rygaard1976]. Later it was shown, that this mice model was not adequate [@Cavallo2011] . Thus, the hypothesis that TME can have a positive role in tumor prognosis is not new. 

The immunosurveillance through immune-editing can be summarized in three processes:  elimination, equilibrium, and escape  [@Dunn2002]. 

The elimination is direct killing of cancer cells or growth inhibition by immune system. The adoptive T cells and NK are actively involved in tumor killing and stimulate other immune cells. The CD8 + cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs)  directly recognize tumor cells.  Employing  perforin- and granzyme-dependent mechanisms they can lyze tumor cells. The CD4 + T cells release  factors to induce proliferation of B cells and to
promote their differentiation to antibody (Ab)-secreting plasma cells, activate macrophages. Macrophages use phagocytosis to eliminate cancer cells [@Vesely2011].

The tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have been associated with an overall good prognosis and better survival in different cancer studies. Also,  abundance of  CD3 + and CD8 +  T cells, NK cells, and γδT cells correlates  with improved outcomes in epithelial ovarian cancers [@Marquez2012]. Several  studies report that the presence of the abundant  immune infiltrate is correlated with good prognosis or better survival [@Kornstein1983; @Baxevanis1994; @Naito1998; @Pages2005].   Spontaneous regression of human tumors has been reported in cutaneous melanoma, retinoblastoma, osteosarcoma, etc.  [@Aris2012].

The equilibrium is the phase when cancer and immune cells coexist and their crosstalk is preventing metastasis.

T cells are the main actor maintaining the equilibrium. Progressively, the tumor cells become more immunogenic as they are not edited by the immune system (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3170416/). The state of tumor cells is then identified as "dormant" and active scientific reports  investigate the possible molecular pathways that maintain dormancy or lead to  escape (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18515327). 

The immune escape is the final process  when tumor cells impair the immune response. 


#### Two-faced nature of immune cells: context-dependent functional plasticity 

Modern vision of TME tumor interactions assumes that tumor can be directed to several molecular pathways. This direction is decided by signals that are native of tumor cell and/or coming from the microenvironment. 

Recent studies unveil ambivalent nature of immune cells of TME. While some as cytotoxic T cells, B cells and macrophages can manage to eliminate tumor cells. Treg cells role is to regulate expansion and activation of T and B cells. Depending on cancer type, they can be either pro- or anit- tumor. For example as it has been shown for Tregs, they can be also associated with improved survival (i.e. in colorectal cancer [@Frey2010]. For innate immunity, there are widely accepted M1 (ani-tumor) and M2 (pro-tumor) extreme macrophages phenotypes in TME [@Qian2010]. Most of the statements seem to be context dependent and not valid universally across all cancer types. We already mentioned Macrophages phenotypic plasticity as well as different behaviour of EMC depending on tumor stage.

From more general point of view, it has been observed that immunodeficiency can correlate with high cancer incidence. Results of analysis based on observations of 25,914 female immunosuppressed organ transplant recipients, the tumor incidence was higher than predicted for multiple cancers. However, the number of breast cancer cases decreased which can be really disturbing if we need to decide on the role of immune defence in tumor progression [@Stewart1995]. This trend was confirmed through a study on individuals with AIDS and other studies. This indicates that immune microenvironment can be cancer stimulating or inhibiting depending on the type of cancer. 

#### Immune cell (sub)types in TME 

Here will be a definition of what is immune cell type, how different phenotypes are can be associated with subtypes and why researches do it 

> Cette espèce de leucocytes a une grande ressemblance avec certains éléments fixes du tissu conjonctif, ainsi qu'avec des cellules endothéliales et des cellules de la pulpe splénique. On est donc souvent embarrassé, surtout lorsqu'on trouve ces leucocytes mononucléaires en dehors des vaisseaux, pour les distinguer des autres espèces de cellules mentionnées.

#### Summary

Cancer is a disease concerning milliards of people with a long history. Scientific community recognises role of the environment where the tumor cells find themselves as an important factor influencing tumor development, prognosis and response to treatment.  TME is a complex environment that constantly interacts with tumor cells, where both tumor and TME influence and shape each other. 

Over the years, many interactions are being discovered and cell types re-defined and described in their context. However, lots of mechanisms and interactions of TME remains unknown due to very heterogeneous nature of this micro environment which leaves room to more extensive investigation by researches.

A therapeutic goal is target interactions that would be able to pivot the essential processes in tumorigenesis or tumor escape in order to put the cells "back on track" and facilitate anti-tumor therapies. 

These goals can be meet thanks to improvement of investigating techniques and data quality and abundance. We will discuss the most important data types used in this project to investigate the TME.

## Quantifying and qualifying immune infiltration (data)

Nowadays, more and more biological data is produced. However, this proliferation of accessible resources is not proportional to generated insights and wisdom. In this thesis, we wok mostly generate *Knowledge* and *Insights* and we hope to generate some *Wisdom* (Fig. \@ref(fig:information-power)). However, in this part, we will introduce the foundation of our analysis: different data types that will be further discussed in chapters that follow.

We will introduce most relevant data types that are used to study immune infiltration of tumors. 

###  Cell sorting {#facs}

#### Flow cytometry

Flow cytometry is a laser-based technology. It uses marker genes: cell surface proteins to sort cells in different compartments. Nowadays, it permits quantification of the abundance of up to 17 cell surface proteins using fluorescently labelled antibodies [@Papalexi2017]. However this techniques is not free from bias, our knowledge about cell markers is limited and several markers may not be relevant in some context. Moreover, the scientific community did not clearly agree on the marker choice even for popular and well studied cell types which introduced additional heterogeneity when independent studies are compared. Also the quality of antibodies may influence the results of the FACs analysis.  Besides those limitations FACs remains quite popular method for analysing cells in complex tissues. It was among first methods that allowed molecular phenotyping of immune cells, a discovery of numerous subsets and thier further functional interpretation.

#### Mass cytometry

Mass cytometry (also known as CyTOF allows for the quantification of cellular protein levels by using isotopes. It allows to quantify up to 40 proteins per cell [@Papalexi2017].

### Microscope Staining{#staining}

Using microscope technics, histopathological cuts are analysed. The number of cells per a unit of area (i.e. mm$^2$) is defined either manually by human or though diverse image analysis algorithms. Current pathology practice utilises chromogenic immunohistochemistry (IHC) [@RamosVara2010]. Multiplexed approaches allow to identify multiple markers in the same histopathology cut. Modern techniques as imaging mass cytometry using FFPE tissue samples uses fluorescence and mass cytometry to identify and quantify marker proteins [@Giesen2014].

The main advantage of aforementioned technics the number of cells that can be analysed and the information about spatial distribution of the different cell types. The limiting factor, as for [cell sorting methods](#facs), is the number of markers (~10-100) and consequently number of cell types that can be identified [@Schelker2017].

The [cell sorting methods](#facs) and [microscope staining](#staining) are usually considered as a gold standard for multidimensional data techniques. The reason why they are not applied at large scale is the cost but also quite laborious and time consuming sample preparation demanding a fresh sample. In contrast, the [-omics methods](#omics) propose more scalable way to measure tumor micro environment. 


### omics {#omics} 

* Some kind of sequencing explanation needed for non-biologists

#### Transcriptome

Transcriptomics is measures the number of counts of mRNA molecules using high-throughput techniques. mRNA is the part of genetic information that should be translated to proteins. It reflects the activity of cell ongoing processes. In contrast to DNA, mRNA is highly variant [@Velculescu1997]. In addition, many genetic and epigenetic events can be either directly observed or indirectly inferred from transcriptomic data. Transcriptome can be measure with microarrays or RNA-seq NGS technology.

Bulk transcriptome data can are quite accessible. They can be obtained from either flash-frozen or formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples, including both surgically resected material and core needle biopsies [@Schelker2017].

The main flaw of transcriptomic data is that the reproducibility between different platforms is limited. As a result, direct comparison between two datasets produced by different platforms is not advised. 

Different strategies can be adapted to analyse bulk transcriptome.

@Cieslik2017 describes five groups of most popular approaches that can be applied to study transcriptome (Fig. \@ref(fig:transcriptome-methods)). Despite a diversity of bioinformatic and statistical tools, the most popular differential approaches, mainly differential gene expression (DGE) based on difference between two experimental conditions.

}
```

(ref:transcriptome-methods-caption) **Five categories of RNA-seq data analysis.** Differential analyses: comparing two (or more) conditions, Relative analyses: comparing to an internal refernce (average, base level), Compositional analyses: inferring cell types or groups of cell types (i.e. tumor purity), Global analyses: pan-tissue and pan-cancer analyses and Integrative analyses: compiling heterogneious data types.

RNA-seq data was proven to be a useful indicator for clinical applications [@Mody2015; @Oberg2016; @Robinson2017]. Its utility for immune profiling was demonstrated in may studies through a use of transcriptomic signatures to predict immunotherapy response or survival [@Chen2016].

In this work transcriptome data are analyzed propose an alternative method to describe immune infiltration. 

#### Epigenome

An epigenome can be defined as a record of the chemical changes to the DNA and histone proteins of an organism. Changes to the epigenome can provoke changes to the structure of chromatin and changes to the function of the genome [@Bernstein2007]. Epigenome data usually contains information about methylation CpG island changes. In cancer, global genomic hypomethylation, CpG island promoter hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes, an altered histone code for critical genes, a global loss of monoacetylated and trimethylated histone H4 were observed. Mathylome profiles can be also use as molecular signature [NMF and other ref]



#### Single cell RNA-seq 

Described above methods of process DNA from hundreds of thousands of cells simultaneously and report averaged gene expression of all cells. In contrast, scRNA-seq technology allows getting results for each cell individually. This is tremendous step forward enhancement of our understanding of cell heterogeneity and opens new avenues of research questions. 

Continuous discovery of new immune subtypes has proven that cell surface markers that are used for phenotyping by techniques like [FACS](#facs) and [immunohistochelistry](#staining) cannot capture the full complexity. ScRNA-seq methods allow to cluster known cell types in subpopulations based on their genetic features [@Papalexi2017]. ScRNA-seq is also able to capture particularly rare cell types as it requires much less of RNA material (1 ng isolated from 100-1000 cells) compared to 'bulk' RNA-seq ( ~ 1 μg of total mRNA transcripts ). It also allow to study cells at high resolution where the phenotypes can re-defined in much more refined scale than previously [@Papalexi2017]

This new data type also brings into the field new challenges related to data processing due to the volume, distribution, noise, and biases. Experts highlight as the most "batch effect", "noise" and "dropout effect" [@Perkel2017]. So far, there are no official standards that can be applied which makes data comparison and post-processing even more challenging. Up to date, there are around 70 reported tools and resources for single cell data processing [@Davis2016] . 

A limited number of single-cell datasets of tumors are made publicly available (@ TABLE ?). 

One can ask why then developing computational deconvolution of transcriptome if we can learn relevant information from single-cell data. Today's reality is that single cell data does not provide a straightforward answer to the estimation of cell proportions. The coverage is not full and sequenced single cells are not fully representative of the true population. For instance, neutrophiles are not found in scRNA-seq data because of they are "difficult to isolate, highly labile *ex vivo* and therefore difficult to preserve with current single-cell methods" [@Schelker2017]. In addition, a number of patients included in published studies of range <100 cannot be compared to thousand people cohorts sequenced with bulk transcriptome methods. This is mostly because single cell experiments are challenging to perform, especially in clinical setting as fresh samples are needed [@Schelker2017]. Today, single cell technology brings very interesting "zoom in" perspective, but it would be incautious to make fundings from a restricted group of individuals universal to the whole population. Major brake to the use of single cell technology more broadly might be as well the price that is neatly 10x higher for single cell sample compared to bulk [@Cedar2018]. 

| Technology |     Price      |
| :--------: | :------------: |
| scRNA-seq  | 3000$ / sample |
|  RNA-seq   | 200 $ / sample |
|    FACS    |  0.05$ / cell  |
|   CyTOF    |    35$/cell    |
In this work, we are using single cell data in two ways. Firstly, in [Comparative… chapter](#results) we compare immune cell profiles defined by scRNA-seq, blood and blind deconvolution (problem introduced in [Immune signatures section](#immune-signatures)). Secondly, in [Heterogeneity of immune…](#map) we use single call data of Metastatic melanoma generated by @Tirosh2016 to demonstrate subpopulations of Macrophages and NK cells. 


## From cancer phenotyping to immune therapies {#immunotherapies}

This section outlines different methods of cancer immune phenotyping and progress in cancer therapies with a focus on immune therapies. It will link the ongoing research on TME with therapeutical potential. 

### Cancer immune phenotypes

Since 20. century physicians decided on common nomenclature that classify tumors into distinct groups that are relatively homogenous or that share common characteristic important for treatment and prognosis. Tumor typing should help to better asses predicting prognosis, to adapt a therapy to the clinical situation, to enable therapeutic studies which are essential in proving any therapeutic progress.

Most of the classifications are based on clinical data. Most common factors taken into account are: the degree of local invasion, the degree of remote invasion, histological types of cancer with specific grading for each type of cancer, possibly various tumour markers, general status of the patient. 

However, cancers with similar morphological and histopathological features reveal very distinct patterns of progression and response to therapy. In the era of gene sequencing, gene and protein expression, epigenome can provide a complementary information. Therefore  gene markers or proteomic abnormalities can integrated into classification panel.  One popular example is a gene signature *PAM50* [@Parker2009] used for prediction of patients' prognosis in breast cancer, patented as a tumor profiling test. 

Since the increase of importance of the immunotherapies, researches proposed several ways to classify tumors based on their microenvironment. Given different parameters describing TME, cancers can be sorted into groups that show similar characteristics. We will discuss most common frameworks that allow to phenotype cancers based on the TME.

The localisation of the immune cells can be an indicator of the state and response to the therapy [@Bindea2013].

The most standard approach is to convey an analysis of histopathological cuts to asses the number of infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Two typical patterns are usually identified: "hot" - immune inflamed and "cold" - no active immune response [@Berghoff2018].

@Chen2017 describes classification into inflamed and non-inflamed tumors, where non-inlamed phenotypes: can be further split into the immune-desert phenotype and the immune–excluded phenotype (Fig. \@ref(fig:immune-phenotypes)). The inflamed phenotype is characterised by rich presence of immune cells : T cells, myeloid cells, monocytes in tumor margin. Along with the immune cels, due to their communication, a high expression of cytokines is characteristic for this phenotype. According to Chen2017, this is a mark of anti-tumor response that was arrested by tumor. The inflamed phenotype has shown to be most responsive to immunotherapies. In the immune-excluded phenotype, the immune cells are present as well but located in the stroma [@Herbst2014], sometimes penetrating inside tumor. However, when exposed to check point immuotherapy, T cells does not gain the ability to infiltrate the tumor, therefore the treatment is inefficient. The immune-desert main features is little or no presence of immune cells, especially T cells. Surprisingly, this tumors have been to proven to rarely respond to the checkpoint therapy [@Herbst2014]. In non-inflamed tumours cytokines associated with immune suppression or tolerance are expressed.

(ref:immune-phenotypes-caption) **Cancer-immune phenotypes: the immune-desert phenotype (brown), the immune–excluded phenotype (blue) and the inflamed phenotype (red).** The immune–desert phenotype is characterised by paucity of immune cells and cytokines. In the immune-excluded phenotypes the T cells are often present but trapped in stroma, enabled to migrate to the tumor site. The immune-inflamed phenotype is rich in immune cells and the most responsive to the immune check point therapies.

The immunogenicity of the tumors can be explained by tumor-intrinsic factors and tumor-extrinsic factors [@Gajewski2006]. Tumor-intrinsic factors are, the neoantigen load and frequency, the mutational load, the expression of immunoinhibitors and immunostimulators (e.i. PD-L1), and alteration of HLA class I molecules. Tumor-extrinsic factors include chemokines regulating T cell trafficking, infiltration of effector TILs and immunosuppressive TILs, and soluble immunomodulatory factors (cytokines). 

A plethora of different computational methods have been developed in order to further characterize tumor samples using different factors. We mention here mainstream methods that cover different approaches of scoring the TME-cancer phenotype. 

#### Immunoscore

#### Immunophenoscore

Different approaches are based on gene expression patterns. Most commonly, machine learning supervised algorithms are trained to match known phenotype (established with microscopy or with clinical features) to genetic patterns or an unsupervised clustering is used to discover new classification. 

An example of well-formulated classification framework is Immunophenoscore [@Charoentong2017], based on publication of @Angelova2015, where methylome, transcriptome and mutation of TCGA CRC dataset (n = 598) was used to describe *immunophenotypes*. Later on, it was reduced to gene expression indicator and summarised in a form of a score. In This scoring scheme is based on the data of 20 solid tumors, using expression of marker genes selected by a Machine Learning algorithm (random forest) for best prediction in each cancer. These indicators can be grouped into four categories: 

* MHC molecules (MHC)
* Immunomodulators (CP)
* Effector cells (EC)
* Suppressor cells (SC)

The immunophenscore (IPS) is calculated on a 0-10 scale based on the expression of genes in each category. Stimulatory factors (cell types) impact the score positively and inhibitory factors (cell types) negatively. Z-scores ≥ 3 were designated as IPS10 and z-scores ≤ 0 are designated as IPS0. A similar conceptual framework called *cancer immunogram* was proposed by @Blank2016 included seven parameters: tumor foreignness (Mutational load), general immune status (Lymphocyte count), immune cell infiltration (Intratumoral T cells), absence of checkpoints (PD-L1), absence of soluble inhibitors (IL–6, CRP), absence of inhibitory tumor metabolism (LDH, glucose utilisation), tumor sensitivity to immune effectors (MHC expression, IFN-γ sensitivity). Nonetheless, the details of *cancer immunogram* use in practice remain unclear and result could be sensitive to patients' and data heterogeneity as no standardisation was proposed. 

@Charoentong2017 claim that the immunophenoscore can predict response to CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1.

#### Immune maps

Description on how immune portraits (NAVIcell) can be used to characterise tumor immune environment.

#### Summary

Despite those facts, the gene expression based classifications are not yet used in clinics. The measured multi-panel mRNA expression, that can be included into category of In Vitro Diagnostic Multivariate Index Assay (IVDMIA) [@Gyorffy2015; @Ross2008], may be a future of TME-based cancer classification, diagnosis and treatment recommendation [@Gnjatic2017]. For this best tools need to be used to properly evaluate the state of TME and tumor-stroma-immune cells communication.

### Immune signatures - biological perspective {#immune-signatures} 

* definition of signature: marker genes, list of genes, weighted list, metagenes
* the general immune signature of signature of immune infiltration and stroma vs immune signature of a specific cell type of functional subpopulation
* purpose of signatures
* availability of immune signatures
* the problem of not consistency of immune signatures
* origin of signatures

> "the gene expression profiles of tumour-associated immune cells differ considerably from those of blood derived immune cells"' [@Schelker2017]

Immune signatures will be also discussed as a part of deconvolution pipeline in the [Chapter 2](#methods) under the section about *basis matrix*.




### Cancer therapies {#cancer_Therapies}

Cancer is a complex disease. Up to date, no uniform and fully effective treatment was proposed and usually different strategies are tested to kill tumor cells. **Surgery** is one of the oldest methods. The cancer is removed from the patient body. There are different ways, more or less invasive, that it can be performed. it is usually applied for solid tumor contained in a small area. **Radiation Therapy** uses high doses of radiation to eliminate tumor cells and shrink tumor mass. It can be applied externally or internally. **Chemotherapy** uses a drug (or a combination of drugs) that kill cancer cells, usually altering cell proliferation and growth. The drawback of radiotherapy and chemotherapy are strong side effects. **Hormone therapy ** modulate hormone levels in the body in order to inhibit tumor growth in breast and prostate cancers. In leukemia and lymphoma, can be applied **stem cell transplants** that restore blood-forming stem cells destroyed by the very high doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy that are used to treat certain cancers. 

Alternatively, **targeted therapies** represent more focused strategy that aims to be more effective and cause less side effects than systematic therapies. Two main types of targeted therapies are small-molecule drugs and monoclonal antibodies. Targeted therapies usually aim to stimulate/inhibit a selected molecular function. A special types of targeted therapies are **Immunotherapies**. Through adtivation/inhibition of immune regulatory pathways, it stimulates immune system to destroy malignant cells. A continuation of targeted therapies is **precision medecine approach**. It is based on genetic information to specify patient's profile and find adapted treatment. A number of innovative treatments targeting a specific change in tumor ecosystem are being tested presently in precision medicine clinical trials [@NCI2018].

### Recent progress in immuno-therapies

The immunotherapies, in contrast with other types of cancers therapies discussed in [the previous chapter](#cancer_Therapies), aim to trigger or restart the immune system to defend the organism and attack the malignant cells. All this, however without provoking persisting inflammation state [@Predina2013]

The idea of stimulating immune system to fight malignant cell was not born recently. Since a long time a possibility of development of an anti-cancer vaccine has been investigated. Unfortunately, this idea faced two important limitations 1) lack of knowledge of antigens that should be used in vaccine to successfully stimulate cytotoxic T cells 2) the ability of cancer to block the immune response also called *immunostat*. Despite those impediments works on anti-tumor vaccines do not cease [@Palucka2013]. A very recent promising an in-situ ani-tumor vaccine was proposed by Sagiv-Barfi et al. [@Sagiv-Barfi2018]. The therapy tested in mice, would be based on local injections of the combination of "unmethylated CG-enriched oligodeoxynucleotide (Cp-G) - a Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9)  ligand and anti-OX40 antibody.  Low doses of CpG injected into a tumor induce the expression of OX40 on CD4+ T cells in the microenvironment in mouse or human tumors. An agonistic anti-OX40 antibody can then trigger a T cell immune response, which is specific to the antigens of the injected tumor". Sagiv-Barfi et al. claim this therapy could be applied to all tumor types, as long as they are leucocyte-infiltrated. As a local therapy, in situ vaccination should have less side-effects than systematic administration. It is now undergoing clinical trials to test its efficiency in human patients.

Another idea involving using immune system as a weapon to fight cancer, would be the use of genetically modified patient's T-cells, carrying *CARs* (chimeric antigen receptors) [@Jackson2016]. After a long period of small unsuccessful trials, recently in 2017, two CAR T-cell therapies were accepted, one to "treat adults with certain type of large B-cell lymphoma" [@FDACARTadult], other to treat "children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)" [@FDACARTALL] , which are, at the same time, the first two gene therapies accepted by FDA. 

However, the two most promising immuno-related strategies with proven clinical efficiency are based on blocking so called immune check point inhibitors: cytotoxic T-lymphocyte protein 4 (CTLA4) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). The anti-CLTA4 antibodies blocks repressive action of CLTA4 on T-cells and they become therefore activated. It was shown efficient in melanoma patients and accepted by FDA in 2015 as adjuvant therapy for stage III metastatic melanoma patients [@FDACTLA4]. PD-1 is a cell surface receptor of T cells, that binds to PD-L1/PD-L2. After binding, an immunosuppressive pathway is activated and T cells activity is dampened. An action of an anti-PD-L1 antibody is to prevent this immune exhaustion [@Chen2017]. A stepping stone for anti-PD-L1 therapies was approval of Tecentriq (atezolizumab) for Bladder cancer [@FDAPDL1Bladder] and anit-PD1 Keytruda (pembrolizumab) initially accepted for NSCLC and further extended to head and neck cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma, gastric cancer and microsatellite instability-high cancer [@FDAPDL1NSCLC]. Since other anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD1 antibodies were accepted or entered advanced stages of clinical trials [@Wolchok2015]. A short history of immunotherapy FDA-accepted treatments can be found in Fig. \@ref(fig:timeline-immunotherapies)

```{r timeline-immunotherapies, fig.cap='(ref:timeline-immunotherapies-caption)', out.width='100%', fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}

  knitr::include_graphics('figures-ext/02-timeline-immunotherapies.pdf')
} else {

}

The main drawback of immunotherapies is a heterogeneity of response rate, which can vary i.e. from 10–40% in case of PD-L1blocking [@Zou2016], suggesting that some patient can have more chances than others to respond to an immune therapy. So far, it has been shown that anti PD-L1 therapies works more effectively in T cell infiltrated tumors with exclusion of Tregs because of lack of difference in expression of FOXP3 in responding and non-responding group of patients [@Herbst2014]. Also some light has been shade by @Rizvi2015 who connected mutational rate of cancer cells to the chances of response to an immunotherapy. 

Despite those fundings, the precise qualifications of patients that should be sensitive to an immunotherapy are not defined [@Pitt2016]. As most patients do not answer to immunotherapies, it stimulates researches to look for better biomarkers and patient stratifications, and pharmaceutical industries to discover new immune checkpoints based therapies.
