# Heterogeneity of immune cell types {#map}

We include here an extract of a *ready to submit* article of Kondratova et al. **(co-first authored by Urszula Czerwinska)** - the abstract and figures which are result of work on single cell heterogeneity.

Explication how deconvolution methodology can be used for analysis of heterogeneity of immune cells 

* describe the context briefly

* describe more in details my part - data analysis of single cell data


To be defined:

* add CAFS (that will maybe appear in *JBM*) 
* add unpublished analysis made for the Nature Immunology *Michea et al.* paper  (to be defined)
* The single T-cell study  (if done)
